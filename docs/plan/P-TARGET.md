> "사람들은 목표는 있지만, 왜 그걸 하고 싶은지 모른다"

| Problem | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Goals exist but reasons don't** | "운동해야지" → Why? → Don't know → Gives up after 3 days |
| **Can't set priorities** | Many things to do but no idea where to start |
| **Hard to structure thoughts** | Don't know how to organize thoughts in their head |
| **Existing tools are too complex** | Notion, mind maps, etc. require too much setup |

| Segment | Characteristics | Core Needs |
| -------- | ---- | --------- |
| **Primary** | College students / job seekers in their 20s | Organize aspirations, find direction |

## 2.3 Persona: 민서 (22, College Student)

**Situation**: Has over 20 things she wants to do but doesn't know where to start. Makes plans but never follows through.

**Pain Points**:
- Has never deeply thought about "why she wants to do this"
- Lists keep piling up in Notion with no organization
- Repeats the same pattern every week (plan → fail → self-blame)

**After Using INU**:
- Clicks 💪 운동 → AI suggests options → click, click → structuring complete
- Sees at a glance in tree view why "건강" matters
- With a clear WHY, priorities fall into place naturally
