## 1.1 Basic Information

| Field | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Service Name** | INU |
| **Meaning** | "The You Within" - A tool for looking inward and understanding yourself |
| **One-liner** | A self-understanding tool that structures goals in a few clicks and identifies WHY to set priorities |
| **Core Concept** | Recommend & Select - Structure goals naturally by clicking AI-recommended options |

## 1.2 Core Philosophy

> **"A person who clearly knows WHY they do something can persist in execution and self-correct their direction, unlike someone who doesn't."**

- Ask "Why?" before setting a goal
- Goals that share the same WHY are connected to each other
- Seeing the connected structure makes priorities clear
- **WHY depth exploration is an optional feature** (ON/OFF in settings, default OFF)
  - OFF (default): Only 1-level WHY is shown. Kept simple
  - ON: Deeper exploration possible by clicking "왜?" inside WHY nodes **(up to 5 levels, based on the 5 Whys framework)**
- MVP focuses on a **single-user self-understanding tool** (social features in Phase 2)

## 1.3 Brand Metaphor: Rising Seal

A seal explores the deep ocean and rises to the surface with the light.

- **Dive**: Deep reflection exploring one's inner self
- **Rise**: Moving into action with a clarified direction
